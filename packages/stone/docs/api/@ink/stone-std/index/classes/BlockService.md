# ~~Abstract Class: BlockService~~

## Deprecated

BlockService is deprecated. You should reconsider where to put your feature.

BlockService is a legacy extension that is used to provide services to the block.
In the previous version of InkStone, block service provides a way to extend the block.
However, in the new version, we recommend using the new extension system.
